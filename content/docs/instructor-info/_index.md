## Office Hours  

Instructor: My office hours are listed in the syllabus. We can either meet in-person in my lab (directions on my website above) or via zoom (see the link on class canvas page). You can drop by anytime during session or you can sign can up for a specific time slot in advance at this [link](https://embruna.youcanbook.me/). If you can’t make it one of those days, let me know and we will find a time that works for you.
