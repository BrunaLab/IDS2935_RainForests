  * Introduce yourself and ask for a topic you're interested in to be included in a class session
  * Ask for clarification on assignments, go over prior ones to find out how to improve on the next one
  * Discuss work we did in class to make sure you understood the key points
  * Get feedback on ideas for class projects
  * Ask questions about applying to graduate school
  * Ask for help arranging a study group
  * Stop by our lab kitchen for a **free tea, coffee, or espresso** (really).
  * Work on your project in our lab conference room (free coffee...).
  * Lots of other reasons.
