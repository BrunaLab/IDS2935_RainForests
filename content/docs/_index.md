#### **Welcome to "IDS 2935: The Future of Rain Forests".**

Tropical Rain Forests cover approximately 15% of the Earth’s land surface but contain over 50% of the world’s biodiversity. They are also the home to millions of people, the source of products central to our lives, shape global climate, and are being cleared at unprecedented rates. **In this Quest 2 class we will investigate the same fundamental questions asked by scientists that study rain forests:**

  * Why are we fascinated by rain forests?
  * How have stereotypes about them permeated everything from pop culture to international relations?
  * What gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity?
  * What are the drivers and consequences of deforestation?
  * Is rain forest conservation compatible with socioeconomic development?
