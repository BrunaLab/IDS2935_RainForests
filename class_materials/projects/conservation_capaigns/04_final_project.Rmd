\vspace{0.3cm}

<!-- Instead of using traditional tests to assess your understanding of the material, we will be using what [Prof. Dan Baldassarre (SUNY Oswego)](https://twitter.com/evornithology/status/1453880536880095233/photo/1) calls #NotTest assignments. -->

### **PROJECT OVERVIEW:**   
The Final Project for this course is to review, synthesize, and communicate the things we have learned this semester in ways that to audiences outside of our classroom. As you can see below, there are some Visual media can have the significant impact on how effectively a message is communicated. Appropriate and strategic visuals can inspire the audience, lend clarity to a message, and, in general, say things that words alone cannot. 

For this project, use the concepts you’ve learned in this course to effectively apply visuals to a business-related message. Below, you will find just a few examples of how visuals can be utilized t   qo communicate a message in the business setting. Feel free to choose one of these examples, or select one that is not listed.


Increasing awareness about issues for which there is the first step towards mobilizing social change. We will put aside whether or not there is indeed an "information deficit"   
So the awareness campaigns also need to point towards specific actions people can take to actually advance rain forest conservation.   
Specifically, you will be developing materials to increase awareness in the UF student population about rain forests and the threats they face
<!-- https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already# -->




Your assignment is to complete **one** of the following project options. You can complete these assignments individually or in collaboration with other students. If you   



  * **Value: **250 Points  
  * **Due: **15 December 2021  
  * **Submission:** Via Canvas  


#### **OPTION 1: Communicating about Rain Forests & Their Conservation**

There are many ways to effectively communicate science topics to non-scientists. One of these is the 'Message Box', which was developed by the organization [COMPASS](https://www.compassscicomm.org/) to help sort and distill information about a topic in a way that resonates with your target audience. The Message Box is often used by scientists talking about their own research when communicating with decision makers; you will be using it to map out how to communicate about complex issues related to rain forests and their conservation to a different target audience: UF undergraduates.

<center>  

![The COMPASS Message Box.](message_box.png){width=70%} 

</center>

##### Instructions: 

1. The Alligator wants to interview you about rain forests for an upcoming article they are preparing about what students are learning in the new 'UF Quest' program. In preparation for your interview, review the [Message Box Workbook](https://www.compassscicomm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Message-Box-Workbook.pdf); it includes blank templates you can use to construct your message box prior to the interview.

2. Pick **five** Issues/Topics covered in class you would like to address during the interview. They can be about historical and cultural perceptions of rain forest and rain forest people, the biology of rain forests and their global ecological importance, or about threats faced by rain forests and approaches to their conservation.

3. Fill out a message box for each of the Issues to bring with you to your interview. Be sure to fill out each of the 5 sections:  

    * **_Audience:_** First-year undergraduate students at UF
    * **_Issue:_** Identify and describe the overarching issue or topic that you are addressing. This should be in very broad terms - the big picture - and formulated as a short, concise, and clear phrase.
    * **_Problem:_** What is the specific topic or conservation issue that you are addressing?
    * **_So What?:_** Why should your audience care about the problem? (2-4 reasons)
    * **_Solution:_** Outline the options for solving the problem. Can your audience do anything to help? Remind yourself of why you are communicating this issue/problem to this audience.  
    * **_Benefit:_** What good things will result from implementing the solution(s)? While it is important to address 'Global' benefits, be sure to emphasize the local and direct benefits to your specific audience in ways that will resonate to them.

##### Rubric:

Each of your 5 message boxes is worth a total of 25 points and will be graded using the following rubric:

\vspace{0.3cm}
```{r assign, echo=FALSE,message = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
compass <- read_csv("./assignments/04_final_project/rubric_compass.csv") %>% 
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T,
                 latex_options="scale_down",
                 font_size = 8) %>% 
  column_spec(1,bold=T) 
compass
# df2<- c("","","TOTAL",sum(assignments$Points))
# assignments <- rbind(assignments,df2)
# landscape()
# assignments[5, 3]<-cell_spec(assignments[6, 3], "latex",  align="c")
# kable(compass,
#       # digits = 2,
#       align="l",
#       format="latex",
#       row.names = FALSE,
#       escape= F,
#       booktabs=T,
#       linesep = "",
#       ) %>%
#    kable_classic_2(full_width = T,
#                 latex_options="scale_down",
#                 font_size = 8,
#                 position = "left") %>%
#   column_spec(1, width = "15em") %>%
#   column_spec(2, width = "13em") %>%
#   column_spec(3, width = "3em") %>%
#   column_spec(4, width = "3em") %>%
#   row_spec(0,hline_after = F, bold=T) %>%
#   row_spec(c(1:5),hline_after = T) %>%
#   row_spec(6,bold=T) %>%
#   add_indent(6)

```

#### **OPTION 2: Communicating about Rain Forests & Their Conservation with very _non_-traditional methods**

The Message Box was originally developed as a tool for scientists that were going to be meeting with policy makers or being interviewed by the news media, and it has proven to be a very effective means of identifying and simplifying the information one is seeking to convey. However, a [recent survey](https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2015/survey-young-adults-do-consume-news-in-their-own-way) found that very few university students (< 20%) actively seek out news from traditional news sources such as CNN or the New York Times. Instead, most university students (~60%) said they got their news by bumping into it on social media platforms. 

##### Instructions

1. Chose **two** Topics / Issues from class to explain to an undergraduate student audience using the Message Box as described in Option 1.  
2. Prepare platform-specific materials that communicate the information in your Message Box on the social media platform of your choice. For example you could:

    * Record TikTok videos (30-60 seconds) in different styles (explainer, street interview, day-in-the-life of a rain forest animal, whatever)^1^.
    * Make fake Tinder profiles for tropical plants seeking animals to pollinate or disperse them [you can make fake ones and doanload the images with [this site](https://tinderkit.com/)] to share on Twitter. Be sure to include information about the biology, ecological importance, and threats faced by these species.
    * Prepare a "(*Celebrity*) as __________" twitter thread (e.g., [Example 1](https://twitter.com/JohnRossMD/status/1436542407278006273), [Example 2](https://twitter.com/autumnsonatah/status/1116323477844316161?s=20), [Example 3](https://twitter.com/adorvtete/status/1116070915656355842?s=20)) with a group of endangered, unusual, charismatic, or weird rain forest plant or animal species as the _________. Include biological information about the species and their conservation status, photo credits, and links to research / conservation efforts. etc.
    * Record a series of Instagram Stories or animated YouTube video.

3. You don't have to actually post your videos, nor do you have to appear in them (though you may if you wish to). Regardless  of your communication format, be sure to use photos that are in the public domain or that have been lisenced under the creative commons. ([Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a great source of photos you can use for free with no attribution required). 

    ^1^ If you choose this option, you might find this [post on TikTok trends](https://invideo.io/blog/tiktok-trends/) useful...though let's be honest, how cool can something be if there is an article telling you how cool it is?. There are also free [templates](https://www.canva.com/create/tiktok-videos/) you can use to help you prepare your videos.
  
##### Rubric:

Each of your 2 message boxes and the associated social media materials is worth 125 points and will be graded using the following rubric:

\vspace{0.3cm}
```{r social, echo=FALSE,message = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
social <- read_csv("./assignments/04_final_project/rubric_social.csv") %>% 
  kbl() %>%

                 latex_options="scale_down",
                 font_size = 8) %>% 
  column_spec(1,bold=T) 
social

```


<!-- #### **Option 3: Palm Oil Survey**  -->

<!-- We can also communicate on much smaller scales and have local impacts. Option 3 is to survey your home^1^ for all products that contain palm oil or its derivatives.  -->

<!-- ##### Instructions -->
<!-- 1. Survey your home for products that contain palm oil or palm oil derivatives. Make a list recording the item and manufacturer.  -->
<!-- 2. Take a picture of you with all the products you find (e.g., piled on the table) -->
<!-- 3. For each item, find an alternative that either doesn't contain palm oil or contains palm oil certified by the [Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil](https://rspo.org/about). -->
<!-- 4. Use the Message Box to craft a message about Palm Oil, its social and ecological impact for tropical rain forests, and alternatives that UF students could use to avoid its consequences. -->
<!-- 5. Write a letter to the Editor of the Gainesville Sun or Independent Alligator based on your Message Box.  -->

<!-- ^1^If you live with a larger group (e.g., co-op or greek housing) recruit some house-mates to help. If you live in a dorm, you can review the list of cleaning products used by UF Facilities and the items being sold in the POD market (note that you can't take pictures of the items in POD). Write and submit a letter to the Editor for the Sun or Alligator in which you argue for alternatives that promote rain forest conservation in light of what you find.    -->

#### **Option 3: Make a Rain Forest Infographic**

##### Instructions

1. Chose **two** Topics / Issues from class to explain to an undergraduate student audience using the Message Box as described in Option 1.  

2. Prepare an Infographic Poster for each of these Message Boxes.

What is an Infographic? It is a “visual representation of information or data”. Put another way, it is an easy-to-understand overview of a topic using a collection of images, data visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, symbols of different sizes), and minimal text. Infographics make information easy to understand and are visually appealing.  I really like this one, which makes clear how prevalent palm oil is in our daily lives: 

<center>  

![A Day in Your Life - Palm Oil (based on design by Philadelphia Zoo)](A-Day-in-Your-Life-with-Palm-Oil-based-on-a-design-by-Philadelphia-Zoo.png){width=60%}  

</center>  

To get started, here is a great overview on [Different Types of infographics and how to make them](https://www.clips.edu.au/infographics/) (see also Figure 3 below). This site includes links to sites where you can make them for free with templates, but the easiest thing might be to make it with PowerPoint. [This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66fnRMbYXsE) will walk you through how to find and import graphics into PowerPoint; step-by-step directions on making an infographic in powerpoint can be found [here](https://graphicmama.com/blog/how-to-make-an-infographic-in-powerpoint/). Just remember: an infographic should be _focused_ (one single message; emphasize its significance to you), _graphic_ (graphics and images tell the story, fewer than 800 words), and _ordered_ (the sequence should be obvious; simple flow paths and cues should guide the reader).

<!-- There are many common types of infographics (see also  [ex. 1](https://piktochart.com/blog/layout-cheat-sheet-making-the-best-out-of-visual-arrangement/), [ex. 2](https://alltimedesign.com/infographics/the-ultimate-infographics-design-cheat-sheet/), [ex. 3](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/infographic-layout-cheat-sheet), [ex 3]. ), -->

<!-- Still need some inspiration or help? There are some really good cheat sheets that explain different infographic layouts ([ex. 1](https://piktochart.com/blog/layout-cheat-sheet-making-the-best-out-of-visual-arrangement/), [ex. 2](https://alltimedesign.com/infographics/the-ultimate-infographics-design-cheat-sheet/), [ex. 3](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/infographic-layout-cheat-sheet), [ex 3]. You can also find free templates at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/infographics/templates/), though this may be most useful to find ideas.  -->

<!-- Finally, a google search of 'Rain Forest Infographics' yielded a ton of [really cool ones that could inspire you](https://www.google.com/search?q=rainforest+infographic&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS828US828&sxsrf=AOaemvKre-yKAA90GEm2I4uu2OCeUyGBqg:1638467860881&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH48q22MX0AhVZTTABHYF2ApwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=2189&bih=1220&dpr=1), and there also some great Pinterest collections of rain forest infographics ([Ex 1](https://www.pinterest.com/alicat1972/rainforest-infographics/).  -->

<!-- 1. Useful Bait: Works well with most of the data; Easy to read and good usability   -->
<!-- 2. Versus/ Comparison: Works well with a lot of information; Design(visual) is very important; Information has to be very interesting -->
<!-- 3. Heavy Data/Lots of Numbers: Works well with marketing strategy; Timeline for project; Can extend to a flowchart   -->
<!-- 3. Road Map: Good for storyline/journey; Can be used as a timeline too -->
<!-- Timeline: Can be a comparison; Good for timeline and journey too; From simple to complex (depends on your data)   -->
<!-- 4. Visualized Article: Needs strong title; Works well with heavy content; Easy to read and understand   -->

#### **OPTION 5: Run the En-Roads Dimulatin for a Group of Friends or your Family**

#### **OPTION 6: Propose your own Project**

Don't like any of the options above? No problem! Propose a different way to creatively communictae about rain forests and their conservation. Below are some possibilities I came up with; you're welcome to tackle one of them or propose something else.  **_If you do want to propose your own project, you need to discuss it with me first. The deadline to do that is December 7, 2021._**

* write a song and record yourself (or a friend) performing it. Or maybe rewrite the lyrics of [these cheesy 1980's love songs](https://www.yourtango.com/2019320830/35-best-cheesy-love-songs-80s-and-90s-lyrics-so-bad-theyre-good) to be about rain forests and record those. 
* create artwork (any medium: digital, ceramics, painting, woodcuts, comics)
* [Make a twitter bot](https://botwiki.org/resource/tutorial/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-the-definitive-guide/) that posts deforestation data
* Make a "rain forest in our lives" infographic
* make a [map showing the flow of resources](https://gisgeography.com/flow-maps/) from the tropics to UF 
* Five-minute Video Recap of course sessions
* Podcast where you interview rain forest plants or animals (inspired by [*Everything is Alive*](https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/everything-is-alive))
* Rain forest fails in Advertising, Marketing, or Popular Culture (with explanations of why they are incorrect)
* New question's for next year's class *Jeopardy*
* organize a fundraiser in support of rain forest conservation
* video game reviews: ( [try the free demo of _Empires of the Undergrowth_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/463530/Empires_of_the_Undergrowth/), If you want to play [_Green Hell_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/815370/Green_Hell/) I have a code for you to download it for free) 
* Create memes to highlight your selected issues, with an emphasis on awareness of the local relevance of rain forests and actions students can take to advance their conservation.
* Create Amazon product pages for things they use every day that are driving deforestation (you can find the template [here](https://ditchthattextbook.com/social-media-templates/)
* Use the Netflix Series template to Imagine a documentary series about a UF student on a quest to learn about rain forests. Maybe the documentary follows them as they learn about how prevalent rain forests are in their daily life, about the diversity of rain forests (e.g., ecological, cultural), about the vital role of rain forests in the global climate cycle, and about the myriad threats to rain forests. Describe the documentary and each episode using this Netflix Series Template. Be sure to think about the final episodes - does the student give up and accept dystopian future without jungles, or do they decide to take bold individual and collective action to advance rain forest conservation? Or maybe a series about a dystopia future *without* rainforests...(you can see some examples of how others have used these templates [here](http://edtechpicks.org/2019/11/netflix-template/))/
