# Assignment 1 - Movie Reviews

## Overview

Your assignment is to watch 5 films and analyze how tropical rain forests are presented in the film and used to advance the films narrative. Your essay should not be a  summary of the film (i.e., a *descriptive review*), nor a judgment that the film is "good" or "bad" (i.e., an *evaluative review*). Your objective is to present a brief analysis (500-700 words) interpreting: 

* how the rain forest setting underscores the film's themes 
* how the film reinforces or subverts stereotypes about rain forests and the people that live in them
* how the depiction of rain forests in the film compares with what you have learned about rain forests in class. 

You must support your claim with specific examples of (1) Dialogue, (2) Characters or character development, (3) Shots, visuals, editing, (4) Props, sounds, scoring, or songs, and (5) Plot points and action. **_Be sure to take notes and fill out the Movie Trope Checklist while screening the film._**

## Film Selection

**Films to review:**  These are the films we will be watching and reviewing:

* Aguirre, Wrath of God
* Anaconda
* Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest OR Avatar
* One assigned (at random) by the Instructor
* One chosen by you from the list below. 

**Please submit the name of the film you are choosing to review via Canvas by 7 Spetember.** If it will help you decide you can watch the trailers by searching for the movie on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). 

**How to watch:** Most of the films are available via the UF Library access to Kanopy, other free streaming platforms, or as DVDs that can be checked out from the UF Library's Course Reserves. A few of them are only available on subscription-based streaming platforms such as Netflix or Amazon, but **there are plenty of movies that do not require subscriptions or paying for a rental.** Please do **_not_** spend any personal funds on this assignment. *The platforms where movies stream at no cost are:*
  
   * [Tubi](https://tubitv.com/)
   * [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/)
   * [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
   * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
   * [Crackle](https://www.crackle.com/)
   * [Pluto TV](https://pluto.tv/en)
   * [Film Detective](https://www.thefilmdetective.com/)
   * [YuppTV](https://www.yupptv.com/)
   * [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
   * [Digitalia](https://www.digitaliafilmlibrary.com/)

**Important Content Warning**: The some of the assigned films contain strong language, nudity, sexual situations, and violence, including sexual assault.  There may be dialogue about or depictions of race, class, gender, sexuality, or other topics that are uncomfortable, disturbing, or offensive. Analyzing these depictions and their broader cultural implications is an important part of this assignment, so I encourage you to prepare yourself for this possibility. However, if you are concerned that you will find the content of the films you have been assigned to be traumatic, please let me know so we can arrange an alternative film for you to review. You do *not* have to tell me why you want to switch, only that you would prefer to be assigned another film. 

**Language:** Some of the films may be partially or entirely in languages other that English and require subtitles. 

**Extra Credit**: Remember what I said about value judgments? Well...let's just put that aside for a moment to say there are some movies that are so ridiculously bad that I will award 10 points of extra credit simply for selecting one of them for your 5th review. 

## Submission Requirements and Rubric

**For each film you must submit the following:**

1. Your critical analysis (250-300 words)
2. A completed 'Movie Trope Checklist' 

**Assignment Submission: **These assignments are to be submitted using the Google Forms link provided in Canvas.  

**Assignment value: ** 250 points (50 points per movie)

**Due Date: ** All reviews are due Sept. 30 by 5 pm.  

**Required Content & Grading Rubric**: The review & checklist for each of your 5 films will be evaluated using the point values, minimum standards, and rubric below. The individual components will be evaluated as:

1. "Exceeds required standards": Essay is of the required length with thorough and well-reasoned arguments and several specific examples as supporting evidence;engaging conclusion that summarizes the
evidence and connects to the thesis and body. Checklist filled out with multiple examples and a time stamp for each event. The examples accurate and the writing is articulate and sophisticated, with few grammatical mistakes or spelling errors. Overall, the paper is well written.

2. "Meets the minimum standards: Essay is of the required length; generally sound argument with some evidence in support of arguments but lacking details or explanation; the checklist is mostly complete but with details such as time stamps missing. There grammatical mistakes or spelling errors. The paper is acceptable.

3. "Incomplete / Unacceptable": Instructor follow-up required to clarify the argument; little or no conclusion. checklist incomplete. Multiple grammatical and spelling errors. Organization is poor.
