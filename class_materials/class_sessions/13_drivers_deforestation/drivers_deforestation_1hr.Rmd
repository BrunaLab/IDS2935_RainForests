1. How many direct suppliers did JBS have in 2020 vs 2009? (7700 vs 16900)
2. How many cattle suppliers - direct and indirect - did JBS buy from in that period? (~60500) 
3. How many slaughterhouses does JBS have in the Amazon region? 
4. Brazil is the world’s biggest beef producer and exporter. How many cattle did it slaughter per tear?  (22.2 million)
5. Why is it so hard to keep cattle related to deforestation out of the supply chain?  
6: Bonus: It is home to 4 percent of the world’s population but eats about ____ percent of its beef. (20%)

What is the solution?

How many direct suppliers did JBS have in 2020 vs 2009? (7700 vs 16900)
How many cattle suppliers - direct and indirect - did JBS buy from in that period? (~60500) 



By the way, here is the link to one of the investigative reports I presented today, where you can see the original figures: [link]. On this page, you can also use an interactive "supply chain visualizer" - click on one of the brands at the bottom, and you can trace the intermediaries and companies from which the leather came.  [link]

Rainforest beef is typically found in fast food hamburgers or processed beef products. In both 1993 and 1994, the U. S. imported over 200 million pounds of fresh and frozen beef from Central American countries. Two-thirds of these countries' rainforests have been cleared, in part to raise cattle whose meat is exported to profit the U. S. food industry. When it enters the U. S. the beef is not labeled with its country of origin, so there is no way to trace it to its source.

<!-- ### **Topic 1 Overview: Paperless Data Collection** (`r t1_overview` min) -->

### **Topic 1: Patterns of Forest Cover & Consequences of Forest Loss

1) Forest - Where is it, How much of it, & The importance of Intact Forest
2) Primary Drivers of Forest Loss
3) What happens to a landscape when you clear forest?
4) What happens when you abandon these areas?


1) Forest has a [technical definition](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-01-01.pdf) according to the UN FAO. Actually, there are many [technical defintions](https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/content/documents/primary-forest-report-final-march-2021.pdf). Plus two of the main resources - FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) and WRI Global Forest Watch (GFW) [differ in some significant ways](https://www.wri.org/insights/insider-global-forest-watch-and-forest-resources-assessment-explained-5-graphics).  

### Demo

1. Click "Map" on the main menu bar.
2. "Land Cover" on the Left icon menu
3. x-out the layers you don't need on the legend

<!-- There are `r time_remain` min remaining that can be used to ----- -->
