## Consumer Choices

1. Our actions as consumers have an impact on tropical forests and forest communities.  Some of these we know about, we may not even be aware of others. 

a) Direct consumption of products. Can be direct (timber, coffee) or indirect (palm oil used in cleaning products).

b) human livelihoods (workers that harvest and process products)

c) Tourism in tropical countries (employees at larger resorts, ecotourism)
