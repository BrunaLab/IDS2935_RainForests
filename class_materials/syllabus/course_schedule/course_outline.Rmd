## Course Description & GenEd Information
\vspace{0.3cm} 
<!-- ***Abridged Version in the UF Course Catalog:***  -->

This course investigates the fundamental issues addressed by scientists studying tropical rain forests, including what gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity, the drivers and consequences of deforestation, why people are fascinated by rain forests, cultural stereotypes about the tropics, and if forest conservation is compatible with socioeconomic development.

<!-- ***Longer, More Exciting Version:***  -->
<!-- Tropical rain forests cover approximately 15% of the Earth’s land surface but contain over 50% of the world’s biodiversity. They are also the home to millions of people, the source of products central to our lives, shape global climate, and are being cleared at unprecedented rates. Students in this class will investigate the same fundamental questions asked by researchers studying rain forests:  -->

<!-- - Why are we fascinated by tropical rain forests? -->
<!-- - What gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity? -->
<!-- - How did 'jungle' stereotypes permeate everything from art to international relations? -->
<!-- - What are the national and international drivers and consequences of deforestation? -->
<!-- - Is forest conservation compatible with socioeconomic development? -->

<!-- Because these questions and their answers are inherently multidisciplinary, the course will include content from the humanities, social sciences, and biophysical sciences. While the course focuses on tropical countries, a central theme of the course is exploring the individual, local, national, and global impacts of tropical rain forests in an increasingly interconnected world. -->

*By the end of the course students will be able to:*  

* Recognize and describe stereotypes about rain forests & their residents
* Analyze rain forest tropes in art, literature, & popular culture
* Discuss & evaluate hypotheses for the origins and maintenance of tropical biodiversity
* Explain & compare human history in rain forests
* Review contemporary threats to rain forests
* Analyze and visualize data on deforestation
* Review and contrast strategies for rain forest conservation & restoration
* Identify rain forests in their daily lives & set personal goals for advancing their conservation
* Produce materials for communicating about rain forests to family and peers

**This course fulfills the following Quest and GenEd requirements:** Quest 2, GenEd Biological Sciences, & GenEd International (N). A minimum grade of C is required for Quest and General Education credit. Courses intended to satisfy Quest and General Education requirements cannot be taken S-U.

## Required Course Materials   

\vspace{0.3cm}  

**Students are not required to purchase any textbooks or course materials; **all materials, including readings and videos, will be available on the course Canvas page. However, many of the assigned readings from the _New York Times_ and _Washington Post_ have dynamic multimedia data visualizations and video that can't be appreciated in the posted .pdf format. _Students in this class should sign up for free online access to the _New York Times_ and _Washington Post_ by following the instructions at [this UF Libraries Website](https://businesslibrary.uflib.ufl.edu/c.php?g=943928&p=7708734)._

**Materials and Supplies Fees**: None.

Learning in our class will be achieved with an array of methods ranging from essays to creative projects. In most class sessions you will also be working with groups of fellow students to complete an in-class assignment that reinforces the major themes of the day's topic. 

\vspace{0.3cm} 
```{r assign, echo=FALSE,message = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
assignments <- read_csv("./assignments.csv") 

df2<- c("","","",sum(assignments$Points)) 
df2<-as.character(df2)
df2[4]<-paste("TOTAL = ",df2[4],sep="")
assignments <- rbind(assignments,df2)
assignments <-assignments %>% select(-Due)

# landscape()
# assignments[5, 3]<-cell_spec(assignments[6, 3], "latex",  align="c")
kable(assignments,
      # digits = 2,
      align="llc",
      format="latex",
      row.names = FALSE,
      escape= F,
      booktabs=T,
      linesep = "",
      # caption="Graded Coursework"
      ) %>% 
   kable_classic_2(full_width = F,
                # latex_options="scale_down",

```

**Attendance:** Though attendance is not required, many of the sessions we will be completing activities in class that count towards your grade. Most of these can be completed independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working collaboratively with the other students. _Some of the in-class activities, however, can not be completed on your own._ If you miss class on one one of these days, you can elect to make up the lost points with extra-credit assignments.  **_If you need to miss class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible_**. We will make arrangements for you to complete any assignments and go over any material you will be missing. I would much rather you focus on your health, attend your conference, or support friends and family in need than struggle to turn in assignments. 

**Participation:** Consistent informed, thoughtful, and considerate class participation is encouraged (and in some cases required). If you have personal issues that prohibit you from joining freely in class discussion, e.g., shyness, language barriers, etc., that is not a problem. Please me know me as soon as possible and we will discuss alternative modes of participation. 

Furthermore, in our class we will explore some challenging, important problems and increase our understandings of different perspectives and approaches for addressing them. These conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in both how we communicate our perspective and what we hear other say. There may be times when we need patience,  courage, imagination, and of course mutual respect to engage our texts, classmates, instructors, guests, and our own ideas and experiences. _Disrespectful or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated_. And always remember that as scholars we must employ critical thinking, rely on data, and cite verifiable sources and experts to interrogate all assigned readings and subject matter in this course as a means of determining if we agree with classmates and instructors. No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint or belief.

**_Grade Assignment_** (based on % of possible points):

\vspace{0.3cm}
> A = 94–100%, A- = 90–93%  
> B+ = 87–89%, B = 84–86%, B- = 80–83%  
> C+ = 77–79%, C = 74–76%, C- = 70–73%   
> D+ = 67–69%, D = 64–66%, D- = 60–63%  
> E	< 60  

**Regrades:** Requests for re-evaluation of any quizzes, exams, or assignments will only be considered if accompanied by a letter explaining why you think you deserve additional credit and the number of additional points you think you deserve. The deadline for submitting these requests is one week after the work has been returned. 

**Grade Points:** For information on how UF assigns grade points, visit: https://catalog.ufl.edu/ UGRD/academic-regulations/grades-grading-policies/

<!-- * IN CLASS: CLASS PROJECT FAIR -->

<!-- \vspace{0.3cm}  -->
<!-- **Experiential Learning Component**: This course has multiple experiential learning activities, including a field trip to the FLMNH Butterfly Rain Forest, home surveys of tropical products, and the gathering and analysis of data on deforestation and biodiversity in different tropical rain forest regions.  -->

<!-- **Self-Reflection Component**: Students will also have multiple opportunities for self-reflection throughout the course. In addition to reflection on their goals and expectations for the class, they will consider the (almost certainly under-appreciated) ubiquity of products derived from tropical plants and animals in their daily lives. Finally, they will have the opportunity to consider what actions they can take as individuals to advance rain forest conservation and the well-being of forest-dependent people. -->
