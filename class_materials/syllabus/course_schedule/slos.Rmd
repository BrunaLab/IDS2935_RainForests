Assessments: In-class activities, Reflective Essay, Final Project - Explain how molecular biology, genomics, remote sensing, computational tools, and other scientific developments have advanced research on the ecology and evolution of rain forest biota (B). Assessments: In-class activities, Analytic Essay. Examine the historical factors that have shaped cultural perceptions of rain forests (Quest 2).  Assessment: In-class activities, Movie Reviews, Final project. Analyze how narratives about rain forests are reflected in different types of contemporary cultural expression (Quest 2).  Assessment: In-class activities, Movie Reviews, Final project - Distinguish between the primary drivers of forest loss and how they vary geographically (B, Quest 2).
